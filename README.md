Hiya! This repository is all about learning C with Babbo. To use this course, click on the chapter directories (folders)
and read the PDFs and/or source code associated with each lesson and chapter. Directories prefixed with a period
(e.g., `.hidden`) have files used to generate PDFs and are unrelated to the course. Here is a summary of what is covered
in this course:

* Chapter 0: Prequisites
    * In this chapter, you will learn about general programming concepts, and complete the tasks you need to start
      coding in C on your computer. No coding is performed in this chapter.
* Chapter 1: Hello World!
    * This chapter gives a C implementation of "Hello, World!", one of the most common ways to introduce a language
      and give ideas about the syntax and complexity of the language.
* Chapter 2: Variables and Data Types
    * Here we start building more interesting, but still basic, programs. We will get into the habit of printing to the
      console through C to confirm our understanding and aid our intuitions about variables and the types of data they
      represent.
* Chapter 3: Command Line Input and Output
    * This short chapter shifts away from exposition and introduces a mechanism for producing potential useful programs: 
      user interaction with the command line.
